The ridge breaks down around New Year\u2019s, bringing a modest refresh Thursday and a more substantial storm Friday with lowering snow levels and accumulating mountain snow. This marks a transition from a melt-freeze, on-piste-focused pattern into an active storm cycle with improving off-piste and powder potential heading into the weekend."}
